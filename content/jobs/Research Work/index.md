**Undergraduate Research Assistant @ Rosie Lab**  
_January 2023 - April 2023_

- Implemented an Emotion Inference system using Large Language Models to predict emotions portrayed in images across diverse everyday scenarios, enhancing the accuracy of emotion detection by 40% and expanding the systemâ€™s applicability.
- Automated the generation of image annotations using CLIP, a text-to-image classification model, resulting in a 75% improvement in work efficiency and a more streamlined annotation process.
- Developed and designed an image-tagging interface using AWS Amplify, improving data storage efficiency in the back-end by 15% and creating a more intuitive annotation process for users
- Outcome: Achieved First Place at SFU Undergraduate Symposium 2023 and presented at the ACII Conference at MIT

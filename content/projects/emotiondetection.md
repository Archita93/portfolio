Emotion estimation in images is a challenging task, typically using computer vision methods to directly estimate people's emotions using face, body pose and contextual cues. In this project, we explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support the contextual emotion estimation task, by first captioning images, then using an LLM for inference.
